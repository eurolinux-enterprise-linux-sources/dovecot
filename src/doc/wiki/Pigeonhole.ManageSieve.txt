Dovecot ManageSieve Server
==========================

ManageSieve service is used to manage a user's <Sieve> [LDA.Sieve.txt] script
collection. It has the following advantages over doing it directly via
filesystem:

 * No need to let users log in via FTP/SFTP/etc, which could be difficult
   especially with virtual users.
 * ManageSieve is a standard protocol [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5804], so
   users can manage their scripts using (hopefully) user-friendlyManageSieve
   clients. Many webmails already include aManageSieve client.
 * Scripts are compiled before they are installed, which guarantees that the
   uploaded script is valid. This prevents a user from inadvertently installing
   a broken Sieve script.

Dovecot's ManageSieve support is distributed in a separate package from the
Pigeonhole project [http://pigeonhole.dovecot.org/]. There exists also an
alternative pysieved [http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pages/Home] ManageSieve
server that works with Dovecot.
